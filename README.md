## .NET Blog API - A project created to practice what I learned in balta.io "Fundamentos do ASP.NET" course

### About the project
The project is an API that manages some crucial data for a modern blog: users, posts and categories. It has a series of endpoints to handle the blog data, allowing us to create, read, update and delete data from database.

### Tecnologies
- The project uses .NET 5 as framework;
- For database, it uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), an open source Firebase alternative that uses PostgresSQL;
- It also uses Entity Framework Core to manage database interactions.
